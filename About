This is my Project where I have tried to design a chatting app just like Whatsapp. Here I have connected Android Studio with FireBase Database(which acts as 
my DataBase for storing Chat and various other type of information).  First in this app we need to create an account either by our own or through google or Facebook.
After that we need to sign in this app.


Through this app we can send text messages from one device to another, update profile picture and information.
